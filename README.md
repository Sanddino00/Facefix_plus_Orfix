This is a combined tool of my prior two tools. 
It now has an auto mode which should handle most mods based on the feedback I got on the orfix for complex mods. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: 
------
Put it in the folder of the mods/mod you want to fix and run it.
------
Selecta mode auto/manual (a/m)
------
Select y or n to process disabled mods, subfolders and create a backup.
------
Confirm your settings y / n 
------
Add a foldername you want to exclude and press enter or press enter to skip if you don't want to exclude a folder.
------
Choose y or n to either confirm the changes or cancel the process.
------

If you find any bugs or problems pls let me now. Feedback is more than welcome :)
